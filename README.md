# CaseCobra with next.js

UNFINISHED PROJECT

---

Why i did this project and what i learned on the way:

- learned how to make a website with next.js
- learn how to use cn() and useRef()
- learn how to use shadcn/ui and other components
- how to create foler and file structure
- how authentication providers (in this case kinde)
- nextjs dynamic route
- that i should never commit .env file :>
- how to reuse animations from other projects (in web) in my project
- animations still are kinda magic for me
- tailwindcss on advanced level and sm: lg: xl: etc
- typescript basics
- dropzone package with error handling

---

Why i didnt finish this project:

- teacher spending too much time on styling and not explain advanced animations
- rushing backend
- creates pages chaotically so only when he finishes we can see results
- spending too much time on drag and drop when i wanted to create e-shop with items to buy
- it looks very nice but he is too fast and 90% of the time i dont know what i am doing, he just simply overcomplicating things for no reason

---

But stiil i learned a lot and i am happy with the result, progress made and the skills acquired, which will help me in the future projects.
